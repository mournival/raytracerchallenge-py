# Chapter 9

Back after a break.

I have decided to redo the steps to uncompress the parsing the test steps. I go
back and forth on this, but right now, I think the step implementations 
should be more explicit, as a form of documentation. Too much of the 
tests were hidden in the parser and lambdas in the environment file.

I should probably add tags to skip the tests, rather than have them
commented out, not added, as well.

This is also the beginning of adding non-sphere geometric objects,
so a lot of refactoring.
