Biggest diversion from the intent of the book: I am using numpy for
the matrix operations. Two reasons:
1. I have done matrix implementations many times, in C++, Java, Typescript
2. Numpy is the (almost?) standard way of doing linear algebra in Python

Really, numpy is at the core of why Python is popular in production code (
its popularity in education is for different reasons). Learning numpy while
doing the project is going to be the biggest benefit to me. Secondary benefits
will be learning pythonic code better, the behave framework, some github
actions, and other miscellaneous skills.
